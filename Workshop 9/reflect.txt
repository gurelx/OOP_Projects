In this workshop, I have solidified my understanding on the base and the derived classes.
Designing, applying, and submitting this workshop was a fairly smooth process. The longest
part I have spent debugging was the = operator overload of the HtmlText class. Since I was
not calling the = operator of the base class inside it, the title of the file was being 
assigned but not the content itself. It took me a while to realize to remember to call it 
as well. 

I also did not quite understand the method const char& Text::operator[](int index) const.
The reason for that is in the document it specifically says that: "The behaviour of the 
operator is not defined if the index goes out of bounds or if the content is null." But
the method itself needed to return a char& value no matter if index is valid or not. So,
I designed the index argument to reset to 0 if it goes beyond the m_content length so 
that it would not give errors.
