In this final project, I have had the chance of repeating almost each object oriented programming 
principle (modular programming, function and operator overloading, and base/derived/abstract 
classes). 

I specifically utilized some modern C++ features in this project unless the instructions
tell me exactly to do one thing. For example, in Vehicle module, I have created the plate and model
members as std::string instead of dynamically allocated c strings, which save me a lot of time for
not dealing with resource management, and gave me more safe options to do operations in strings 
instead of less safe functions like std::strcpy(). 

Since my code is far from being bulletproof, I have modified my code along the milesones and as the
testers require more and more precision. For instance, I forgot simple requirements like calling the 
copy constructor of the Vehicle module in copy constructors of Car and Motorcycle until Milestone 4. 
They were fixed in the final version.

The most challenging part of the project was the final milestone, since I had to remember the class 
methods I have written weeks ago while bringing whole modules together. For example, I have 
struggled in a part where I have to compare the plate of a Vehicle to a cstring. I could not access 
the plate number since the method to get the plate was protected. But there was == overload which I 
wrote in ms3.
