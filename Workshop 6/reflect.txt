In this workshop I have practised the copy constructors, iofstream, and iostream operator
overloads. The most difficult issue to solve in the lab part was the load() and save() 
methods since I am used to use regular C methods for file manipulation like fscanf and 
open()/close(). I had to debug the block including fstream and ostream multiple times.
For the DIY part, many of my function definitions were similar to the lab part (like = 
and += overloads) and the most difficult part was the << operator overload. The reason
for that is the method itself is declared out of the class, but it is supposed to print
private class members. Eventually I had to create two extra methods to return the number
of fruits in the basket, and prints out the fruits and the price with the specified 
format. Then I called those functions in the helper function.
