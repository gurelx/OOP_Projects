In this workshop, the first concept I have learned was to include a new library called iostream, for the C++ methods like cin, cout. etc. 
The second concept I learned was the notion of scopes and using namespaces for defining the scope of some modules, functions, etc. 
I have used sdds namespace for this workshop. I also learned how to declare a global variable and make it visible and usable by each cpp 
file that includes the same header file, with extern keyword. I used it to declare a global variable for the dictionary for each function 
to use and change. The most challenging part of this workshop was reading the dictionary file properly since one word may have one or many 
types and definitions. I solved the issue by using two fgetc functions (one for the new line and one for the tab) and utilizing them as 
indicators to understand whether the line read is a word or a type/definition.
