In these series of workshop parts, I have better understood the modifier and query methods, 
constructors and deconstructors, and the importance of creating class members as private, 
and making them accessible through the public functions. I have also learned about the cin 
and cout referencing, to be able to change their behaviour in the forthcoming workshops.
The most challenging issue in the lab part for me was to align the output printed with coutRef.
Since I wasn't properly resetting the cout buffer, I had lines as:

1..-Economy Plus  Aisle: 
	Barney Gumble........................... 7D

Then I figured out how to properly reset the cout. In the DIY part, most challenging issue
was to understand how to dynamically create an array if the correct number is input (4,16,or 22).
I was pretty confused about the new operator in the main.cpp which is:

t = new TourBus(num);

Because we had learned to use the new operator with [], or without specifying a number at all.
After that I tried to create a constructor with an int argument and it solved the problem.
