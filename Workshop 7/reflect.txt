In this workshop, I have solidified my understanding about the syntax of base and derived classes.
Buggy issues about this workshop was mainly about the wrong syntax. For example, to create my derived
class I figured out that I have to use:

class Dumper:public VehicleBasic

'public' keyword was substantial here since main was using aDumper.NewAddress(destination) and
without base class being public it could not access the NewAddress method.

I also had to figure out how to call the base constructor to initialize the derived constructor.
I have tried to call the constructor itself inside the Dumper constructor but gcc gave errors. So 
I have used this in my definition:

Dumper::Dumper(const char* plateNo, const int year, int capacity, const char* address) : VehicleBasic(plateNo, year)
