In this workshop, I have learned the concept of classes, class members, member functions, and objects.
Different than structs, I had to declare whether a member is public or private explicitly. I had also
taken advantage of using class members in the member functions freely without the need of creating an
object for the function. I also learned cin/cout and able to use it more efficiently with cin.ignore()
and cin.clear(). The hardest challenge in this workshop was to use the procedures of starting to write
the code (like putting out skeleton code, compiling one module at a time, writing comments, using 
debugger, etc.) since the functions were calling each other so much. I have failed to avoid nested if
statements (arrow code) which is a bad practice in bool sdds::CC::read() function.
