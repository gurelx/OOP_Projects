In this workshop, I have learned how to define different types of operator overloads. I did not know in 
the lab part that how the type conversion operators should be called. So instead of using them like 
"bool(object)", I have used them like "object.operator bool()". Then I corrected my mistake in the DIY part.
The most challenging part of the DIY was to find the return types of each operator overload, because they were
not specified. In my operator "+" overload, I have tried to return an object reference "Mark&" and tried to 
modify "this" inside the method, but the compiler gave me the error: "+ operator is ambiguous" since the method
have been used with a "const Mark" in the main. So I changed my method to const, and instead of modifying "this",
I have created a local Mark, modified it and returned it. But this time, the result is not returned outside the 
method, since the local Mark I created was erased after the method is executed. So I finally changed my return 
type from "Mark&" to "Mark", and it solved the issue.
