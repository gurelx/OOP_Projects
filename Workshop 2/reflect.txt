In this workshop, I have had chance to practice the concept of dynamic memory allocation in detail.
I have learned to create dynamic memory for a struct and struct members, and I understood that I have
to delete first the allocated memory of the struct members one by one, then the memory of the struct
itself to free the memory or I might encounter what is called a memory leak. I also get used to the 
cin and cout instead of using printf. The most challenging part for me was to figure out how to close
the file in my load function in DIY part since I got memory leak errors for not properly freeing the 
memory of FILE* ptr. I solved it by using the closeFile function inside of the deallocateMemory 
function so that when called in the main, it makes sure to close the file.
